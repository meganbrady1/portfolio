        <p id="bio">
          I started drawing when I was a small child and as I've grown into adulthood I have been lucky enough to experiment with multiple different mediums including graphite, charcoal, graphic art, stained glass, and animation.
           When it was time to pick a career I knew that I wanted to study an area that would give me creative freedom and I have found that in GIMM (Games Interactive Media Mobile) at Boise State University.<br><br>
           Growing up in Tacoma, Washington I attended Stadium high school where opportunities to take fine art classes in advanced drawing and stained glass were available.  From there I attended Seattle Pacific
           University and studied a year in Computer Science but quickly found myself missing the visual arts.  My brother told me about his program at Boise State and after some consideration I decided to give it a chance. <br><br>
           Since moving to Boise and having the opportunity to take multiple GIMM courses I have developed skills in Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, Premier, and Animate, as well learning how to develop in Unity C# and web development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
